# Responsive Web Design - Legacy üåê

This repository contains the projects completed as part of the **Responsive Web Design** certification offered by [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). The certification was a significant step in my web development journey, covering essential concepts in HTML, CSS, and responsive design.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This repository is legacy as the certification is part of the previous freeCodeCamp curriculum. However, the projects included here remain a demonstration of my early progress in web development.
